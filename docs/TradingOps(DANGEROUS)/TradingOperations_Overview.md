## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Always test on demo** before using in live trading.
2. Double-check order parameters (symbol, volume, SL/TP, expiration) before sending.
3. Use [OrderCheck](../Calculations_And_PreliminaryVerification/ShowOrderCheck.md) for validation.
4. Handle errors properly ‚Äî server rejections may occur due to margin, invalid price, or market state.
5. Be especially careful with **CloseAllPositions**, as it forcefully exits all trades.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Use calculation functions (`OrderCalcMargin`, `OrderCalcProfit`) **before placing trades**.
* Implement logging for every order send/modify/delete.
* When modifying orders, always re-validate new parameters.
* Apply rate-limiting ‚Äî avoid sending too many trade requests per second.

## üéØ Purpose

This block is the **core execution engine** of your trading system. It allows you to:

* Enter the market (market orders).
* Place conditional entries (limit, stop, stop-limit).
* Manage and modify existing positions.
* Exit positions safely (individual or all-at-once).

üëâ Treat these methods as **live ammunition**: extremely useful but risky if mishandled.
