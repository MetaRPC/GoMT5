## üéØ Purpose

* Quick **activity metric**: how many trades were executed in the selected period.
* Useful for **statistics**, **reports**, and **trading frequency analysis**.
* When combined with `ShowOrdersHistory`, gives both **orders placed** and **deals executed**.

## üß© Notes & Tips

* Always ensure `from < to`, otherwise you‚Äôll get empty results or errors.
* Use empty `symbol` when you want total activity across all instruments.
* Works well for periodic reporting (daily, weekly, monthly trade counts).
* üîó For `from/to` handling see: **History_Range(important)**.
