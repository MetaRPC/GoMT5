## üéØ Purpose

* Fetch a **single executed deal** from history.
* Use when you know the exact deal ticket and need full info (audit, debugging, reconciliation).
* Complements `ShowOrderByTicket`, but operates on **deals** instead of orders.

## üß© Notes & Tips

* Deals are immutable: once executed, their record does not change.
* Not all deals have corresponding orders (e.g., balance operations).
* Always check `Profit` and `Commission` fields to compute net effect.
* Time is UTC ‚Äî convert if you need local reporting.
