# ShowOrdersHistory

> **Request:** retrieve and display the list of past orders within a specified time range.

---

### Code Example

```go
from := time.Now().AddDate(0, 0, -7) // 7 days ago
to   := time.Now()                   // now

svc.ShowOrdersHistory(ctx, from, to)
```

Internally this calls the account method to fetch all closed/cancelled/expired orders that fall into the requested time interval.

func (s *MT5Service) ShowOrdersHistory(ctx context.Context, from time.Time, to time.Time)
```

* Inspect what trades/orders were placed and how they evolved.
* Debug past executions (why order was cancelled or rejected).
* Collect statistics (counts, volumes, durations).

## üß© Notes & Tips

* MT5 differentiates **Orders** (instructions) from **Deals** (executed fills). Orders may result in zero, one, or many deals.
* History can be large ‚Üí always restrict `from/to` range.
* Use `ShowDealsCount` or per-ticket lookups (`ShowOrderByTicket`, `ShowDealByTicket`) for more targeted queries.
